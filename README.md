# This is a Landing Page Demo



## Summary
This is a simple static landing page that was built without using any frameworks and is responsive.

This project was inspired by some of the designs on the [Apple iTunes website](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). It isnâ€™t a copy, but there are some obvious similarities. 

The purpose of this landing page is to demonstrate some of my skills as a web developer.
